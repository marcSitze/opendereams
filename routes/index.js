            and complex problems. With a background in economics, data science
             and finance, he founded or co-founded several successful companies
              utilizing data to forecast the future.  Hans is passionate about
              education and artificial intelligence and believes the data has
              the potential to help humans access education, solve global
              problems and lead better lives.  With a Swedish-Filipino heritage,
               his parents instilled a strong sense of work ethic with an emphasis
                on education - the most powerful tool to shape one's future.  Hans
                co-founded Open Dreams on the belief that talent is universal, but
                 opportunity is not, driven to close that gap and build a bridge to
                 academic opportunities.  When not solving problems, Hans is devoted
                 to his family and adores his three children - Hansito, Sofia Lolita and
                 Aviva Lilia.`

            Not long ago, our co-founder Blaise Buma, was one of many kids in his hometown in Cameroon struggling
            to make ends meet. As bright he was, he didn't know which path to take to turn his dreams into reality.
             Luckily for him, a bright young girl named Morgan saw something in him that he hadn't yet recognized in
             himself - his full potential.

            Morgan knew withe the right training and support Blaise would succeed at any top university in the world.
             She was right. Two years after their encounter Blaise had earned a full scholarship to Washington & Lee College in Virginia.
              He then went on to study at the London School of Economics in England, to become a Schwarzman Scholar in China,
               and to be accepted to Harvard Business School. That little extra push from a person that cared is what got him here today
               . Now it is his turn to give back.`
